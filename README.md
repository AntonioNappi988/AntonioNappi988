ðŸ‘‹ hi welcome to my github page


I am a passionate computer science student based in Napoli. I am interested in a wide range of topics related to computer science, including programming, algorithms, artificial intelligence and computer security. I am currently pursuing a course of study in computer science at https://www.unisa.it. I am fascinated by the way technology is evolving in the world and I am striving to acquire knowledge and skills that will allow me to contribute to this evolution. In my spare time, I like to explore new programming languages, solve algorithmic problems, and participate in open-source projects. I hope I can continue to learn and grow in computer science and make a difference in the world through my passion for technology.
